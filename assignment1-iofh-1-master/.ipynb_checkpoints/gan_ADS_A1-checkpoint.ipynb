Look at the figure above to make sure you understand why this is the case. Arguably, if the government would tax an outrageous amount like for example 100% of your income, presumably no one would bother to work since the entire paycheck would be taken away by government in the form of taxes, so the government would also collect 0 revenue. \n",

In the real world, models of reality are often multivariate, they depend on several independent variables, where perhaps $f(x, y, z, h)$ models government revenue as a function of $x$ (tax rate), $y$ (GDP growth), $z$ (inflation) and $h$ (unemployment rate). With such multivariate functions, you cannot look at a plot of the function since we cannot visualize functions in more than three dimensions. Hence, we need to optimize the function using algorithms for either symbolic differentiation or numerical differentiation. For this exercise, symbolic differentiation should suffice."
